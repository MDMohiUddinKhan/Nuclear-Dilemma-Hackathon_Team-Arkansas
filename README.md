# Final Round Team Role: Chief Engineer of a Nuclear Power Plant on the shore of Red Sea
### Objective: To assure local residents with Engineering explanation that "Fresh water the NPP produces along with regular Nuclear Electricity generation comes from 2 separate production site. So, fresh water the NPP produces is completely nuclear-radiation free & mass people can use that water for daily use which can mitigate water scarcity problem in Middle Eastern Desert & NPP can supply water at minimal cost than traditional Water_Treatment_Plants because they use the Bi-product (Electricity & Flue Gass Thermal Heat) of daily power generation to infiltrate & mineralize the sea-water".
